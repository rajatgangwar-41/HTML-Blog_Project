            <h4>Nature : A Boon for all</h4>
            <p>
                <em style="background-color: #1a89171a;">Nature</em> is the mother of all, as it helps to sustain our life. It is our companion since eternity. 
                Despite the importance <br>of nature in human life, we are spoiling its balance only due to our greediness.
                Millions of years ago, when the <br>knowledge of man was not better than an animal.
                At that time man used to get all the things needed for life only<br> from nature. Even today, 
                at the heights of science, our requirements are met by nature only. Nature is a boon<br> given to us, 
                as it protects crores and crores of organisms living on the earth. It gives us forests which are the 
                <br>lungs of Earth.
            </p>
            <hr align="left" width="50%" color="red">
            <h4>Challenges of Nature</h4>
            <p>
                Our lives as human beings started on this planet Earth and since then we are exhausting its resources. 
                But, in return,<br> we are exposing it to the external threats of destruction and mistreatment. Due to this, 
                beautiful forests have been <br>destroyed, rivers have been polluted and vast open lands have been consumed for 
                buildings and factories. We are giving <br>challenges to nature by doing activities as hunting down animals, 
                cutting down trees, releasing poisonous gases and <br>polluting rivers. Our earth is literally experiencing 
                many strokes of destructive activities due to which the river sources <br>are going dry, plants are dying as 
                well as species are eliminating. Today's world is facing the biggest problem of <br>
                <em style="background-color: #1a89171a;">global warming, </em>which has a serious impact on our 
                environment. So we all think seriously about our activities and help <br>to bring such 
                situations under control.

            <h4>Conservation of Nature</h4>
            <p>
                Conservation of nature is another important issue. Although governments are employing various means to 
                conserve nature, <br>individuals must also come forward to contribute to saving nature. Therefore, everyone 
                must do the tree plantation, restricting <br>the use of paper, stopping wastage of water and electricity. 
                Not only these we have to stop ill practices like the hunting of animals. <br>Also, we must go for rainwater 
                harvesting systems. If each one of us contributes their own bit, the difference will be tremendous <br>for 
                nature. The beginning of life, as well as the continuation of life on earth both, are a very complex 
                process of nature. <br>Every organism is important for the conservation of nature.
            </p>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>
                In the end, I would just say that please don't keep my words to yourself only. I request all to spread the 
                message around so that<br> every person can become a responsible global citizen who can contribute to saving 
                our planet. Also, focus on energy consumption. <br>Therefore, switch off the power button, if no one is in the 
                room. Do not use personal vehicles, and follow public transportation. <br>We can even use bicycles for small 
                distances to protect your environment. Thus, through these simple yet effective measures, <br>everyone can 
                contribute greatly towards saving our mother nature from further exploitation.<br><br>
                
                Thank You!
